## Overview
This project is an analysis of movie data with the aim of providing recommendations for Microsoft's new movie studio. The analysis includes identifying the most popular movie genres, the most successful movies in terms of revenue and ratings, and the best time of year to release a movie. The project includes a Jupyter notebook with the data analysis, as well as a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key findings.
